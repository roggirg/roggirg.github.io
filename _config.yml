name: Roger Girgis
bio: "I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in the Shared Reality Lab at the Center for Intelligent Machines in McGill University. My research interest lies in the development and application of learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. In my most recent project, I worked on developing an application to assist visually impaired individuals with the task of intersection crossing. This was accomplished by formulating it as a deep imitation learning problem where we design agents that learn how to choose the optimal heading relying solely on first-person images. My current research interest lies in the use of reinforcement learning algorithms to tackle other visual deficiency problems, such as scene description, outdoor/indoor navigation, etc."
